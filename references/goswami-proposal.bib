In this review, we provide an overview of the link between the gut microbiome and neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders. We also introduce analytical methods used to assess the connection between the gut microbiome and the brain. The limitations of the methods used at present are also discussed.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of the gut microbiome on the initiation and intensity of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) prompted by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is widely acknowledged. Nevertheless, there is inconsistency in the gut microbial associations with irAEs reported across various studies.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive analysis leveraging a dataset that included published microbiome data (n = 317) and in-house generated data from 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenome samples of irAEs (n = 115). We utilized a machine learning-based approach, specifically the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, to construct a microbiome-based classifier capable of distinguishing between non-irAEs and irAEs. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive analysis, integrating transcriptome and metagenome profiling, to explore potential underlying mechanisms.
RESULTS: We identified specific microbial species capable of distinguishing between patients experiencing irAEs and non-irAEs. The RF classifier, developed using 14 microbial features, demonstrated robust discriminatory power between non-irAEs and irAEs (AUC = 0.88). Moreover, the predictive score from our classifier exhibited significant discriminative capability for identifying non-irAEs in two independent cohorts. Our functional analysis revealed that the altered microbiome in non-irAEs was characterized by an increased menaquinone biosynthesis, accompanied by elevated expression of rate-limiting enzymes menH and menC. Targeted metabolomics analysis further highlighted a notably higher abundance of menaquinone in the serum of patients who did not develop irAEs compared to the irAEs group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores the potential of microbial biomarkers for predicting the onset of irAEs and highlights menaquinone, a metabolite derived from the microbiome community, as a possible selective therapeutic agent for modulating the occurrence of irAEs.},

High-throughput technology has been widely applied to characterize the microbial ecosystems, which led to an explosion of different types of molecular profiling data, such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metabolomics. For analysis of such data, machine learning algorithms have shown to be useful for identifying key molecular signatures, discovering potential patient stratifications, and particularly for generating models that can accurately predict phenotypes. In this review, we first discuss how dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota is linked to human disease development and how potential modulation strategies of the gut microbial ecosystem can be used for disease treatment. In addition, we introduce categories and workflows of different machine learning approaches, and how they can be used to perform integrative analysis of multi-omics data. Finally, we review advances of machine learning in gut microbiome applications and discuss related challenges. Based on this we conclude that machine learning is very well suited for analysis of gut microbiome and that these approaches can be useful for development of gut microbe-targeted therapies, which ultimately can help in achieving personalized and precision medicine.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify the core gut microbial features associated with type 2 diabetes risk and potential demographic, adiposity, and dietary factors associated with these features.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used an interpretable machine learning framework to identify the type 2 diabetes-related gut microbiome features in the cross-sectional analyses of three Chinese cohorts: one discovery cohort (n = 1,832, 270 cases of type 2 diabetes) and two validation cohorts (cohort 1: n = 203, 48 cases; cohort 2: n = 7,009, 608 cases). We constructed a microbiome risk score (MRS) with the identified features. We examined the prospective association of the MRS with glucose increment in 249 participants without type 2 diabetes and assessed the correlation between the MRS and host blood metabolites (n = 1,016). We transferred human fecal samples with different MRS levels to germ-free mice to confirm the MRS-type 2 diabetes relationship. We then examined the prospective association of demographic, adiposity, and dietary factors with the MRS (n = 1,832).
RESULTS: The MRS (including 14 microbial features) consistently associated with type 2 diabetes, with risk ratio for per 1-unit change in MRS 1.28 (95\% CI 1.23-1.33), 1.23 (1.13-1.34), and 1.12 (1.06-1.18) across three cohorts. The MRS was positively associated with future glucose increment (P {\textless} 0.05) and was correlated with a variety of gut microbiota-derived blood metabolites. Animal study further confirmed the MRS-type 2 diabetes relationship. Body fat distribution was found to be a key factor modulating the gut microbiome-type 2 diabetes relationship.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal a core set of gut microbiome features associated with type 2 diabetes risk and future glucose increment.},

As the role of microbiota in the etiopathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders is more clearly understood, microbiota-based (or as we propose, “fecomodulation”) treatment options are increasingly discussed in the context of treatment. Although their history dates back to ancient times, the importance of psychobiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has only recently been recognized. Despite there being few preclinical and clinical studies, the evidence gathered to this point suggests that consideration of the microbiome in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders represents an area of significant therapeutic potential. It is increasingly hoped that such treatment options will be more reliable in terms of their side effects, cost, and ease of implementation. However, there remains much to be researched. Questions will be answered through germ-free animal experiments and randomized controlled trials. In this article, the therapeutic potential of microbiota-based options in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders is discussed in light of recent research.},

Various factors, including host genetic predisposition, environmental factors, lifestyle, diet, antibiotic or nonantibiotic drug use, etc., affect the composition of the gut microbiota. Recent publications have highlighted that an imbalance in the gut microflora, known as dysbiosis, is associated with the onset and progression of neurological disorders. Moreover, characterization of the microbiome-host cross talk pathways provides insight into novel therapeutic strategies. Novel preclinical and clinical research on interventions related to the gut microbiome for treating neurological conditions, including autism spectrum disorders, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and stroke, hold significant promise. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of the potential involvement of the human gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, with a particular emphasis on the potential of microbe-based therapies and/or diagnostic microbial biomarkers. This review also discusses the potential health benefits of the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and synbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation in neurological disorders.},

In particular, the gut microbiota has been shown to not only be involved in brain development but also in the modulation of behavior, neuropsychiatric disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. The precise mechanism by which the gut microbiota can affect the development of Alzheimer's disease is unknown, but the gut microbiota is thought to communicate with the brain directly via the vagus nerve or indirectly through signaling molecules such as cytokines, neuroendocrine hormones, bacterial components, neuroactive molecules, or microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids. In particular, interventions such as probiotic supplementation, fecal microbiota transfer, and supplementation with microbial metabolites have been used not only to study the effects that the gut microbiota has on behavior and cognitive function, but also as potential therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease. A few of these interventions, such as probiotics, are promising candidates for the improvement of cognition in Alzheimer 's disease and are the focus of this review.},

Current research is increasingly focusing on the potential association between the microbiota and various neuropsychiatric disorders. The microbiota resides in various parts of the body, such as the oral cavity, nasal passages, lungs, gut, skin, bladder, and vagina. The gut microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract has received particular attention due to its high abundance and its potential role in psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the microbiota presents in other body tissues, though less abundant, also plays crucial role in immune system and human homeostasis, thus influencing the development and progression of neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, oral microbiota imbalance and associated periodontitis might increase the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. Additionally, studies using the postmortem brain samples have detected the widespread presence of oral bacteria in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. This article provides an overview of the emerging role of the host microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders and discusses future directions, such as underlying biological mechanisms, reliable biomarkers associated with the host microbiota, and microbiota-targeted interventions, for research in this field.},

Oral microbiota can enter the bloodstream and trigger inflammatory responses or translocate to the brain through the trigeminal nerve or olfactory system. Hence, the concept of the oral microbiota-brain axis has emerged. Several hypotheses have been suggested that the oral microbiota can enter the gastrointestinal tract and affect the gut-brain axis; however, literature describing oral-brain communication remains limited. This review summarizes the characteristics of oral microbiota and its mechanisms associated with mental health disorders.

To identify novel therapeutic targets, a comprehensive understanding of the disease etiology is needed, especially in the context of the holobiont, i.e., the superorganism consisting of a human and its microbiotas. Much emphasis has been placed on the role of the gut microbiota in the development, exacerbation, and persistence of psychiatric disorders; however, data for the oral microbiota are limited. The oral cavity houses the second most diverse microbial community in the body, with over 700 bacterial species that colonize the soft and hard tissues. Periodontal diseases encompass a group of infectious and inflammatory diseases that affect the periodontium. Among them, periodontitis is defined as a chronic, multi-bacterial infection that elicits low-grade systemic inflammation via the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as local invasion and long-distance translocation of periodontal pathogens. Periodontitis can also induce or exacerbate other chronic systemic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes and can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recently, periodontal pathogens have been implicated in the etiology and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders (such as depression and schizophrenia), especially as dysregulation of the immune system also plays an integral role in the etiology and pathophysiology of these disorders. This review will discuss the role of the oral microbiota associated with periodontal diseases in anxiety, mood and trauma- and stress-related disorders. Epidemiological data of periodontal diseases in individuals with these disorders will be presented, followed by a discussion of the microbiological and immunological links between the oral microbiota and the central nervous system. Pre-clinical and clinical findings on the oral microbiota related to periodontal diseases in anxiety, mood and trauma- and stress-related phenotypes will be reviewed, followed by a discussion on the bi-directionality of the oral-brain axis. Lastly, we will focus on the oral microbiota associated with periodontal diseases as a target for future therapeutic interventions to alleviate symptoms of these debilitating psychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {In the 21st century, neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) are on the rise, yet the causal mechanisms behind this global epidemic remain poorly understood. A key to these unknowns may lie within the vast communities of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the body (microbiota), which are intimately linked with health and disease. NPDs were recently shown to be connected to gut microbiota, which can communicate with and influence the brain through the Gut-Brain-Axis (GBA). Parallel studies examining oral microbiota and their connections to the brain also suggest that microbes in the mouth can similarly influence NPD outcomes. However, the mechanisms and pathways that illuminate how oral microbiota and brain communicate in NPDs remain unknown. Here, we review identified mechanisms and pathways that oral microbiota use to engage the brain, and we lay the theoretical foundation for an oral-microbiota-brain axis (OMBA). Specifically, we examine established neuroinflammatory and immune system activation responses that underpin interactions between the oral microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS), detailing four specific mechanisms: (1) microbial and metabolite escape, (2) neuroinflammation, (3) CNS signaling, and (4) response to neurohormones. We then scrutinize why including the OMBA, in addition to the GBA, is critically needed to elucidate specific causal relationships between microbial dysbiosis and observed NPD development and progression. Furthermore, we argue for comprehensive, interdisciplinary approaches that integrate lab-based microbiome research and population-level studies that examine the OMBA to improve NPDs. We specifically identify key anthropological perspectives that integrate sociocultural, epidemiological, genetic, and environmental factors that shape the oral microbiome and its interactions with NPDs. Together, future studies of the OMBA in conjunction with interdisciplinary approaches can be used to identify NPD risks and improve outcomes, as well as develop novel intervention and treatment strategies.},

ABSTRACT={<p>There is a growing body of evidence highlighting the significant role of gut microbiota in various pathologies. We performed a systematic review to review the different microbiota involved in neuropsychiatric diseases. 50 studies (23 studies for autism spectrum disorders, 18 for major depression, and 9 for schizophrenia), representing 2,137 patients and 2,844 controls. Concerning the microbiota, the genera <italic>Prevotella, Clostridium, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, Megamonas, and Faecalbacterium</italic> were the ones detected with the most frequent variation of their relatives abundance. We also assess the overlap between the different pathologies. This study provides new insights into the complex relationship between the brain and the gut and the implications in neuropsychiatric pathologies. The identification of unique signatures in neuropsychiatric diseases suggests new possibilities in targeted anti or probiotic treatment.</p>}}

Recent data propose the etiopathogenetic role of intestinal microflora in autism. The aim of this study was to elucidate changes in fecal microbiota in children with autism and determine its role in the development of often present gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and possibly other manifestations of autism in Slovakia. The fecal microflora of 10 children with autism, 9 siblings and 10 healthy children was investigated by real-time PCR. The fecal microbiota of autistic children showed a significant decrease of the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio and elevation of the amount of Lactobacillus spp. Our results also showed a trend in the incidence of elevated Desulfovibrio spp. in children with autism reaffirmed by a very strong association of the amount of Desulfovibrio spp. with the severity of autism in the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI) restricted/repetitive behavior subscale score. The participants in our study demonstrated strong positive correlation of autism severity with the severity of GI dysfunction. Probiotic diet supplementation normalized the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, Desulfovibrio spp. and the amount of Bifidobacterium spp. in feces of autistic children. We did not find any correlation between plasma levels of oxytocin, testosterone, DHEA-S and fecal microbiota, which would suggest their combined influence on autism development. This pilot study suggests the role of gut microbiota in autism as a part of the “gut-brain” axis and it is a basis for further investigation of the combined effect of microbial, genetic, and hormonal changes for development and clinical manifestation of autism.}

However, the traditional approaches have not fully explored the integration of oral biology, microbiology, and neurology to further understand aroma release and perception mechanisms. Herein, to address the existing challenges in this field, we introduce the oral–microbiota–brain axis (OMBA), an innovative framework that encapsulates the interactive relationships among saliva and the oral mucosa, the oral microbiota, and the brain in aroma release and perception. This review introduces the OMBA and highlights its role as a key interface facilitating the sensory experience of aroma. Based on a comprehensive literature survey, the specific roles of the oral mucosa, oral microbiota, saliva, and brain in the OMBA are discussed. This integrated approach reveals the importance of each component and the interconnected relationships within this axis in the overall process of aroma release and perception. Saliva and the oral mucosa play fundamental roles in aroma release and perception; the oral microbiota regulates aroma release and impacts olfactory perception; and the brain's intricate neural circuitry is central to the decoding and interpretation of aroma signals. The components of this axis are interdependent, and imbalances can disrupt aroma perception. The OMBA framework not only enhances our comprehension of aroma release and perception but also paves the way for innovative applications that could heighten sensory experiences.},

The goal of creating the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD) is to provide the scientific community with a body site-specific comprehensive database for the more than 600 prokaryote species that are present in the human oral cavity based on a curated 16S rRNA gene-based provisional naming scheme. Currently, two primary types of information are provided in HOMD—taxonomic and genomic. Named oral species and taxa identified from 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of oral isolates and cloning studies were placed into defined 16S rRNA phylotypes and each given unique Human Oral Taxon (HOT) number. The HOT interlinks phenotypic, phylogenetic, genomic, clinical and bibliographic information for each taxon. A BLAST search tool is provided to match user 16S rRNA gene sequences to a curated, full length, 16S rRNA gene reference data set. For genomic analysis, HOMD provides comprehensive set of analysis tools and maintains frequently updated annotations for all the human oral microbial genomes that have been sequenced and publicly released. Oral bacterial genome sequences, determined as part of the Human Microbiome Project, are being added to the HOMD as they become available.

We attempted to predict gut microbiome α-diversity from {\textasciitilde}1,000 blood analytes (laboratory tests, proteomics and metabolomics) in a cohort enrolled in a consumer wellness program (N = 399). Although 77 standard clinical laboratory tests and 263 plasma proteins could not accurately predict gut α-diversity, we found that 45\% of the variance in α-diversity was explained by a subset of 40 plasma metabolites (13 of the 40 of microbial origin). The prediction capacity of these 40 metabolites was confirmed in a separate validation cohort (N = 540) and across disease states, showing that our findings are robust. Several of the metabolite biomarkers that are reported here are linked with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and kidney function. Associations between host metabolites and gut microbiome α-diversity were modified in those with extreme obesity (body mass index ≥ 35), suggesting metabolic perturbation. The ability of the blood metabolome to predict gut microbiome α-diversity could pave the way to the development of clinical tests for monitoring gut microbial health.},

	abstract = {Background
Growing evidence supports that alterations in the gut microbiota play an essential role in the etiology of anxiety, depression, and other psychiatric disorders. However, the potential effect of oral microbiota on mental health has received little attention.

Methods
Using the latest genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data of the oral microbiome, polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of 285 salivary microbiomes and 309 tongue dorsum microbiomes were conducted. Logistic and linear regression models were applied to evaluate the relationship between salivary-tongue dorsum microbiome interactions with anxiety and depression. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was utilized to compute the causal effects between the oral microbiome, anxiety, and depression.

Results
We observed significant salivary-tongue dorsum microbiome interactions related to anxiety and depression traits. Significantly, one common interaction was observed to be associated with both anxiety score and depression score, Centipeda periodontii SGB 224 × Granulicatella uSGB 3289 (P depressionscore = 1.41 × 10−8, P anxietyscore = 5.10 × 10−8). Furthermore, we detected causal effects between the oral microbiome and anxiety and depression. Importantly, we identified one salivary microbiome associated with both anxiety and depression in both the UKB database and the Finngen public database, Eggerthia (P IVW − majordepression − UKB = 2.99 × 10−6, P IVW − Self − reportedanxiety/panicattacks − UKB = 3.06 × 10−59, P IVW − depression − Finngen = 3.16 × 10,-16 P IVW − anxiety − Finngen = 1.14 × 10−115).

Conclusion
This study systematically explored the relationship between the oral microbiome and anxiety and depression, which could help improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and propose new diagnostic targets and early intervention strategies.},

	abstract = {Cancer is a complex disease that deregulates cellular functions at various molecular levels (e.g., DNA, RNA, and proteins). Integrated multi-omics analysis of data from these levels is necessary to understand the aberrant cellular functions accountable for cancer and its development. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) approaches have become a useful tool in integrated multi-omics analysis of cancer data. However, high dimensional multi-omics data are generally imbalanced with too many molecular features and relatively few patient samples. This imbalance makes a DL based integrated multi-omics analysis difficult. DL-based dimensionality reduction technique, including variational autoencoder (VAE), is a potential solution to balance high dimensional multi-omics data. However, there are few VAE-based integrated multi-omics analyses, and they are limited to pancancer. In this work, we did an integrated multi-omics analysis of ovarian cancer using the compressed features learned through VAE and an improved version of VAE, namely Maximum Mean Discrepancy VAE (MMD-VAE). First, we designed and developed a DL architecture for VAE and MMD-VAE. Then we used the architecture for mono-omics, integrated di-omics and tri-omics data analysis of ovarian cancer through cancer samples identification, molecular subtypes clustering and classification, and survival analysis. The results show that MMD-VAE and VAE-based compressed features can respectively classify the transcriptional subtypes of the TCGA datasets with an accuracy in the range of 93.2-95.5\% and 87.1-95.7\%. Also, survival analysis results show that VAE and MMD-VAE based compressed representation of omics data can be used in cancer prognosis. Based on the results, we can conclude that (i) VAE and MMD-VAE outperform existing dimensionality reduction techniques, (ii) integrated multi-omics analyses perform better or similar compared to their mono-omics counterparts, and (iii) MMD-VAE performs better than VAE in most omics dataset.},

We show that a variational autoencoder is able to integrate these two distinct data types without any previous knowledge of the datasets. VAMB outperforms existing state-of-the-art binners, reconstructing 29-98\% and 45\% more near-complete (NC) genomes on simulated and real data, respectively. Furthermore, VAMB is able to separate closely related strains up to 99.5\% average nucleotide identity (ANI), and reconstructed 255 and 91 NC Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides dorei sample-specific genomes as two distinct clusters from a dataset of 1,000 human gut microbiome samples. We use 2,606 NC bins from this dataset to show that species of the human gut microbiome have different geographical distribution patterns.

	abstract = {Human microbiota plays a key role in human health and growing evidence supports the potential use of microbiome as a predictor of various diseases. However, the high-dimensionality of microbiome data, often in the order of hundreds of thousands, yet low sample sizes, poses great challenge for machine learning-based prediction algorithms. This imbalance induces the data to be highly sparse, preventing from learning a better prediction model. Also, there has been little work on deep learning applications to microbiome data with a rigorous evaluation scheme. To address these challenges, we propose DeepMicro, a deep representation learning framework allowing for an effective representation of microbiome profiles. DeepMicro successfully transforms high-dimensional microbiome data into a robust low-dimensional representation using various autoencoders and applies machine learning classification algorithms on the learned representation. In disease prediction, DeepMicro outperforms the current best approaches based on the strain-level marker profile in five different datasets. In addition, by significantly reducing the dimensionality of the marker profile, DeepMicro accelerates the model training and hyperparameter optimization procedure with 8X–30X speedup over the basic approach.

The increasing prevalence of connected car data usage in insurance requires highly accurate and interpretable models. Deep learning (DL) models have outperformed traditional Machine Learning (ML) models in multiple domains; despite this, they are underutilized in insurance risk pricing. This study introduces an alternative DL architecture, TabNet, suitable for insurance telematics datasets and claim prediction. This approach compares the TabNet DL model against XGBoost and Logistic Regression on the task of claim prediction on a synthetic telematics dataset. TabNet outperformed these models, providing highly interpretable results and capturing the sparsity of the claims data with high accuracy. However, TabNet requires considerable running time and effort in hyperparameter tuning to achieve these results. Despite these limitations, TabNet provides better pricing models for interpretable models in insurance when compared to XGBoost and Logistic Regression models.}

abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one.In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

	abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},
